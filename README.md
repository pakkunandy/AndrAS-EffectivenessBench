# AndrAS-EffectivenessBench
The Benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of AndrAS tools. We randomly selected 5 vulnerable apps from DroidBenchâ€™s Android-Specific category
and 17 apps from Ghera, a well-known Android vulnerability benchmark repository. As each of these only has one vulnerability, we also included two multi-vulnerability apps, Diva and InsecureShop15, used for pentesting practice.
Finally, two custom apps cover some unaddressed cases. We only gathered the apks of existing resources. Links for the resources for more exploration:
